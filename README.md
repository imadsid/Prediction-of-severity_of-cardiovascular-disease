Title - ROLE OF METABOLIC OBESITY AND BMI IN PATIENT WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: HOSPITAL BASED STUDY

Introduction- Obesity comes about when energy intake, principally stored as triglycerides, exceeds energy expenditure.The associations between body weight and metabolic abnormalities are not straight forward. A significant proportion of subjects with obesity do not develop dysmetabolic status and conversely, likewise dysmetabolic status can be present in lean subjects also. Therefore, it will become more important to distinguish obese individuals at high risk for obesity-related metabolic diseases from those who are metabolically ‘healthy’. The dysmetabolic status might be clinically important in subjects with normal weight as well. There has been considerable interest recently in the establishment of clinical criteria to identify individuals who are potentially at risk for metabolic and cardiovascular complications, but there are no comparative studies on those associations with angiographic CAD. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to compare findings of angiographic CAD according to groups by metabolic obesity (Insulin resistance syndrome) and weight status

Objectives: 1.To study the severity of Coronary Artery Disease, according to groups by metabolically obese and/or weight status. 2.To compare the association of insulin resistance , Lip(a) & hsCRP with severity of angiographic CAD among four groups

Theme Relevance: 1.Relative importance of Obesity and metabolic obesity in relation to severity of coronary artery disease among four groups. 2.Helpful to find how the insulin resistance syndrome is associated with the severity of coronary artery disease. 3.Association of hsCRP, Neutrophil /Lymphocyte ratio and Lip(a) in severity of coronary artery disease among the four groups.

Challenges:

1.Distributing the patients into 4 different groups by seeing their anthropometric and clinical parameters.
2.Follow up of patients one month after angiogram to see the effect of lifestyle on their BMI .
